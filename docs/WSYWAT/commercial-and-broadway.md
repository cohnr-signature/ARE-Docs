## Guiding Unions into Anti-Racism

### IATSE

**We demand the divestment from IATSE and its local unions until they comply with antiracist practices.** 
*If the aforementioned demand is not met, we will demand the formation of BIPOC Entertainment Unions.* (For more detail, please see the following section on Unions.) 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* What are the historic practices that are problematic? Do the issues hold true in the DC local community? 
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* As we enter into a contract with IATSE, how can we use our platform to further this demand? 
:::

### CSA

**We demand the divestment from the Casting Society of America (CSA) as the arbiter of industry standards, with its national oversight of hundreds of casting directors, until they comply with the following:** 

* Change the racial makeup of their membership and board leadership as stated above within the next five years. 

* Dismantle the seniority/apprentice membership requirement system in the next five years. Publish and implement anti-racism policies for all members within the next six months. 

* Require all members to undergo anti-racism and anti-bias training annually. 

* Create an anti-nepotism policy within the next six months. 

* Put an end to free and unpaid labor by implementing a transparent and competitive pay rate for BIPOC casting interns, assistants, and associates when working in large casting offices. 

* Put an end to the project-to-project independent contracting of BIPOC assistants and associates in large casting offices that employ more than 3 salaried casting directors. 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* As we hire NY casting agents (members of CSA), we should not be afraid to open a dialogue on their Anti-Racism practices. Follow the progress of CSA's response to this closely.

## Encouraging Broadway Theatre Owners To Embrace Anti-Racism

### By Renaming Theatres

**We demand that Broadway theatre owners rename 50% of the theatres they own with BIPOC theatre artists’ names.**

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* While there are only a few spaces at Signature named after individuals, we believe the only space named after a BIPOC individual is the Shen. As we gear up for an expansion, we should be mindful of how spaces are named and who they are named after. This also speaks towards stewarding more BIPOC donors, etc.

### By Introducing Transparency into Production Contracts

**We demand that Broadway theatre owners abolish the current system of secret handshakes that give theatre rentals to the same producers over and over again.**

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Looking at the slate of our 2021 season, that represents a mix of signature family members and new/diverse artists
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Look at longstanding artistic partners that are predominately white - (i.e. casting directors, writing teams, creatives, etc.). How can we maintain those relationships while welcoming more space at the table for BIPOC Artists? 
:::

### By Incubating Talent

**We demand that Broadway theatre owners take an active role in developing BIPOC talent, including BIPOC producers.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

## Encouraging Commercial Producers To Embrace Anti-Racism

### By Incubating Talent

**We demand that individual commercial producers actively seek to find and develop more BIPOC co-producers. Reserve space at the table--make them among the first people you reach out to for producing opportunities.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Be thoughtful about how we choose outside producer teams to enter partnerships with. 
:::

---

### By Valuing Diversity

**We demand that individual commercial producers value the uniqueness that diverse projects offer; do not assign risk to them.**

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* There are many cultures that we have yet to explore in our story telling (i.e. LatinX and indigenous tribes). Seek to tell their stories on our stages without fear of making ticket goals (budget accordingly similar to new works)
:::

---

### By Primarily Hiring BIPOC

**We demand that individual commercial producers ensure that each of your productions have 50+% BIPOC hires. Employ only directors who will subscribe to your conditions of creating an inclusive workspace and support them by pointing them to resources.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Making a stronger effort to assemble a more diverse creative team and cast with each project. 
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* If/when bringing in a white director, include this discussion, even before the initial offer. Make sure they align with these goals before bringing them on to lead. 
:::

## Communicating About Wages

**We demand that all current gag orders or any other orders given by general managers and producers as a requirement of employment that inhibit communication/conversation surrounding wages be terminated, and all future orders that inhibit communication/conversation surrounding wages must cease.**

## Stopping Discriminatory Language

### In Parlance

**We demand the discontinuance of racially charged and insensitive language and/or labels in regards to BIPOC artists/staff.** 

* Language around lighting BIPOC bodies on stage must be stripped of any racially insensitive or discriminatory undertones or implications. 

* Racially charged language and/or labels shall not be used in the workplace by creatives, cast or management in regards to or about any BIPOC actor’s appearance. *Non-BIPOC employees are to be held responsible for educating themselves on this unacceptable language. 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED

:::

### As Part of Exploration

**We demand the discontinuance of the usage of racial slurs in rehearsals, performances and/or as ad libs, unless the recitation of a racial slur is part of the actor’s work in the production.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We endorse this. 
:::

## Creating BIPOC Spaces

**We demand producers foster and fully support the creation of BIPOC affinity groups and spaces.**

## Ending Unnecessary Competition

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* Is this something we are guilty of? Consult with BIPOC artists that have worked with us on this topic.
:::

---

## Casting Without Race Where Unneccesary

**We demand the eradication of the practice of making SOME roles open to BIPOC actors and making actors of every race compete for those few slots. Acknowledge that the majority of roles are not racially specific--their stories are not about race--and can be played by actors of any race.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We endorse.
:::

---

## Training in Anti-Racism

**We demand that there be adequate and ongoing Anti-Racism Training and oversight for all creatives, cast and management.** 

* The Broadway League must mandate Anti-Racism Training for every producing partner/commercial investor of every commercial theatre/Broadway show. 

* An anti-racism policy statement must be verbally stated and physically distributed at the start of every casting, PR, marketing, rehearsal, and tech process. 

* Every company of each show must engage in Implicit Bias Training during the rehearsal process and bi-annually for the duration of the run, provided by the producer in association with Actors Equity. 

* Every commercial production must have a dedicated EDI specialist present. 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Anti-Racism training for all staff through Wayfinding. 
:::
:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* We do not have a clear plan/goals on if/how we would implement Anti-racism training for all artists. Though important, this is costly and logistically difficult given the nature of rolling new hires.
:::

## Unmuzzling Personal Expression

**We demand the immediate eradication of any language, written or verbal, that prohibits or discourages any BIPOC artist/staff member from mentioning/celebrating/claiming their own identity and genetic makeup with regard to social media and media as a whole. This silencing is an act of racial discrimination and will not be tolerated.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Signature's code of conduct does not restrict affiliates from mentioning/celebrating/claiming their own identity and genetic makeup on social media.
