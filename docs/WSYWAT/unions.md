# Unions

## For Actors Equity Association 

### Training in Anti-Racism

**We demand mandatory and ongoing Anti-Racism Training for all union members.** 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* Would AEA fund this? 
:::

---

### Instituting Gap Training

**We demand the institution of Gap Training for future BIPOC production stage managers.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Kerry is given the same Anti-Racism training the staff gets.
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We historically do not have BIPOC representation on our Stage Management teams. Though it is not our place to provide gap training, we can make stronger efforts to bring in BIPOC representation into our SM teams. If we are finding it hard to find qualified, local SM's and ASM's, focus on bringing in BIPOC PA's to train them to move up.

* Do we turn out BIPOC representation in our SIS stage managers? How can we better bridge that gap in our professional world?

* Make sure that Kerry continues to be provided the same Anti-Racism Training and resources the staff gets N/A

### Hiring Diverse Production Teams
 
**We demand that production teams be made up of 50% or more BIPOC.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Widely discussed in other parts of this document, but if this is endorsed by AEA, it is one more way for us to be accountable by this goal.
:::

### Instituting BIPOC Feedback Pipelines

**We demand the institution of a streamlined and transparent process for the proper documentation of issues/concerns brought to the attention of stage management, AEA and non-AEA deputies, and artistic leadership, including a timeline, as well as transparent communication.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* WERK working group is revising the harassment and discrimination policy as well as streamlining the complaint reporting process across the theatre.
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* While this point is mainly asking for consistent practices across all theatres, which we are certainly receptive to, this also relates to the work being done in the workplace standards group at Signature regarding consistent reporting of issues/concerns.

## For the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees

### Increasing Membership Diversity

**Build the number of BIPOC members to at least 50% of the unionâ€™s total within 5 years.** 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* As we ramp up to enter an agreement with IATSE, it is important to recognize that we will play a small role in shaping the metrics for the area local. 
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Support this initiative by working harder to bring in BIPOC members to the union calls in our staff, crew, and overhire (once we ratify the agreement with IATSE). 
:::

### Dismantling Seniority System

**Dismantle the seniority system in the next five years.** 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* Is this something we would be contributing to? 
:::

---

### Training in Anti-Racism

**Mandate ongoing Anti-Racism Training.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Signature's Full Time Staff that are (soon to be) IATSE members will receive Anti-Racism Training this year. :::

---

### Incubating BIPOC Membership

**Create more shadowing opportunities for BIPOC.**

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Find opportunities here. 
:::

---

### Creating BIPOC Spaces

**Create affinity spaces for BIPOC members to help/hear/heal.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Signature's Affinity space is open to all members. 
:::

---

### Clarifying Hiring Practices 

**Become completely transparent with regard to their hiring practices.**

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* How does this apply to Signature?
:::

---

## For the Society of Directors and Choreographers 

### Agreeing on Intimacy Direction

**We demand the codifying of an agreement in regards to intimacy direction.**

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We don't see this as an issue if this were to be voted into effect and would offer a union contract with benefits if we were to hire an ID that is SDC.
:::

---

### Clarifying Hiring Practices

**We demand that SDC creates a complete accounting of the hiring percentages of BIPOC versus white directors at the end of any given theatrical season of every SDC signatory theater. This list should be broken down into new plays, classics and revivals. We want to see a full accounting. We demand an end to the practice of hiring BIPOC directors to direct only BIPOC shows -- while white directors are hired for EVERYTHING, including BIPOC shows.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* With the exception of this year, if you were to pull a report of our stats on this, we recognize that we would fall short in ensuring an equitable balance of our seasons directors. However, this season we have made tremendous improvements with 3 out of the five directors being BIPOC, and 2 of the three BIPOC directors being women.
:::
:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* Find opportunities for BIPOC directors to direct a show that is not exclusively a BIPOC story.
* Continue to bring in more female directors, particularly BIPOC female or female identifying. We recognize that to date, we have only hired 3 female BIPOC directors for a main stage show (Liesel Tommy, Liliana Blain Cruiz, Candis C. Jones) and two of them were hired this year. 
:::

## For the United Scenic Artists 

### Diversifying Membership

**We demand that 50% of the total number of union members be from BIPOC communities.** 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* While this point is asking for 50% representation in their membership, we can set a goal and standard to ensure that roughly 50% of the USA contracts we give out a season are given to BIPOC USA Members. Historically, we don't come close to this.
* We MUST make a stronger effort to bring in BIPOC scenic designers. It is important to recognize that in our 31-year history, we can think of only 3 shows where a BIPOC scenic designer was hired (one of them was this year).
* Hire BIPOC assistant designers. Cultivate a list of names for designers to select from. 
:::

---

### Creating BIPOC Affinity Group

**We demand the immediate formation of a BIPOC affinity group.** 

:::note ALREADY DOING
* Our affinity space extends to all BIPOC artists when they are at the theatre (though this point is for the union to establish one, which we would also support).
