# Funding & Resources

## Funding Sustainable Growth

**Fund sustainable growth for BIPOC organizations, especially post-COVID.** 

* The current crises facing our nation—COVID, institutional racism, and economic turbulence—will undoubtedly affect BIPOC organizations the most. For those that survive, the path towards sustainability and growth will be treacherous. Funding to help these organizations weather the storm and identify a pathway for growth and sustainability is imperative. Seeding the future of these organizations will be crucial in authentically capturing this cultural moment and retelling the story for future generations. 

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* Should Signature agree to not apply for/accept funding specifically for EDI initiatives? Currently have not received any grant funding for “underserved” initiatives (ex: KIPP).

## Supporting Career Development

**Support mentorships, apprenticeships and career development, particularly in design and technical production** 

* Small production teams/staffs, or sometimes a single person on staff juggling multiple projects, are often unable to support the vision of guest designers. 

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We think this is a great idea, with the requirement that any of these things that require work (internships/apprenticeships) are paid positions.

## Reciprocating BIPOC Collaborations

**When engaging BIPOC theatres for collaborations with white-created institutions, we demand reciprocal and collaborative partnerships.** 

* We insist all our partnerships be equitable, including a valuation of our cultural competency that grants your institutions credibility, authenticating your commitment to BIPOC artists on the strength of our relationships. All co-productions must be rooted in equity and co-constructed decision making. We demand ongoing participation and that subsidiary rights do not come from BIPOC artists’ pockets. We also demand proper credit for our work and a cultural legacy that honors our contributions, interrupting the cycle of theft and extraction.

:::caution MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED
* Although we do not necessarily do co-pros, how else can we serve as a connector to organizations who have been historically overlooked?
* Foundations are starting to pay more attention to who serves on review panels? How can we bridge that gap? Can we request more diverse reviewing panel?

:::tip SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
* We agree with this point.
