# Overview

From September 2020 through March 2021, Signature’s WeSeeYouWAT Subcommittee, consisting of six full-time staff members from the AR&E Working Group, representing a variety of positions, tenure, and perspectives, met on a weekly basis to undergo a deep analysis and thoughtful discussion on the document “BIPOC Demands for White American Theatre”.

Every demand listed within the original document was reviewed point by point, and the committee recommended a list of actions or areas for further exploration.

The Subcommittee feels that each section of the document should be assigned a small committee of AR&E members who will work with the necessary staff and affiliates to review each section of the document for further discussion, if necessary, make recommendations, and prioritize the implementation process. It is the goal of the subcommittee for this report to spark the necessary discussions to create lasting, structural changes within the organization.

**The Subcommittee would like the AR&E Working Group to note the following important points:**

* This document represents the work of six people who recognize that we may not have thought of every solution to the issues expressed. We expect to build in your ideas as we move further into this process.

* We recognize that Signature does not have direct control over everything in the document, particularly on topics such as unions, press agencies, commercial theatre, etc. That being said, we hope to use this report to hold ourselves accountable and to better position Signature to lead by example within our industry.

* We are in the midst of a search for Signature’s new Artistic Director, who will play a critical role in advancing Signature’s commitment to anti-racism and equity.

* It is understood that Signature’s work in Anti-Racism and Equity operates on a continuum. Views and actions may have already evolved since the Subcommittee began working through this document in October 2020.
