## Fundraising Transparently

**We demand transparency in fundraising and the distribution of funds as it relates to BIPOC artists’ work.** 

* Cease the practice of raising money to engage BIPOC artistic work but using most of the funds raised for institutional overhead. 

* Publish total dollars earned by white artists and staff in a season versus total dollars earned by BIPOC artists and staff, according to titles and positions.

* Stop exclusively fundraising from BIPOC communities to support the development of BIPOC work. 

* STOP asking Tribal Nations to fund your projects with American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Indigenous artists and communities; consider how those funds will be diverted from tribal infrastructure and cultural retention projects. In regards to the historic deficits of Tribal Nations, predominantly white institutions (PWIs) need to find other resources to ethically fund their projects with American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Indigenous artists and communities. 

* Publish an organizational budget showing how dollars are allocated. 

:::note ALREADY DOING

Not specifically for publication, but we have the info if anyone asks, we can decide whether or not to release it. N/A

* We don't currently do this, and if we ever do a work specifically about Native/Indigenous culture that we don't ask any Indigenous populations to invest in it.
